This python file aims to complete the neilman-wunsch alignment algorithm through taking
an fna file of 2 DNA sequences, performing the alignment on the sequences as well as
calculating the score, then finally writing the newly aligned sequences and their
scores to an output file of .fna format.
This project was part of an extracurricular course within my undergrad.
